Report on Completing ICS 2102 Assignment We
As a first-year computer science student, We have completed the tasks for ICS 2102 Assignment We, which required writing C programs to solve real-world problems. Below, We outline my understanding of each question and how We approached solving them.
Question 1: Game Program
This question introduced a simple game where the user inputs a lucky number for a certain number of rounds. The program checks whether the remainder, after dividing by a secret number, results in a win, draw, or loss, updating the total score accordingly.
Understanding: We identified that the program needs conditional statements to handle the outcomes: draw (remainder is zero), win (even remainder), or loss (odd remainder). A loop was required to handle multiple rounds.
Approach:
1. Used a for loop to iterate through the number of rounds.
2. We implemented if-else conditions to check the remainder and update the score.
3. Checked the final score to determine the game outcome.
Challenge: Understanding how to calculate remainders using the modulus operator (%).
Learning: We gained confidence in implementing loops and conditional statements effectively.
Question 2: Student Grading System
The task involved calculating and displaying a student’s average mark and grade based on three subject marks, with an option to compute for multiple students.
Understanding: The program required input handling, calculation of averages, and mapping averages to specific grades.
Approach:
1. Used scanf to input student details and marks.
2. Calculated the average and applied the grading scale using if-else conditions.
3. We implemented a loop with a user prompt to allow program continuation (Y/N).
Challenge: Ensuring the average was correctly computed and rounded where necessary.
Learning: We practiced handling user input and designing programs with repeat functionality.
Question 3: Credit Worthiness Program
This question required validating a client’s purchase based on their credit limit and purchase value.
Understanding: The program compared the total purchase value (price × quantity) against a given credit limit.
Approach:
1. Used a while loop to re-prompt for valid input if the purchase exceeded the credit limit.
2. Displayed appropriate messages for valid or invalid purchases.
3. We included the option to process multiple clients.
Challenge: Ensuring that incorrect inputs would prompt the user to try again.
Learning: We learned how to validate input using loops and conditional checks.
Question 4: Tax Computation Program
This program calculated the tax and net pay based on an employee’s gross pay and number of dependents, using predefined tax rates.
Understanding: The problem involved checking conditions for tax rates and computing tax and net pay.
Approach:
1. Used if-else statements to determine the tax rate based on gross pay and dependents.
2. Calculated the tax payable and net pay using simple arithmetic operations.
3. Displayed the output in a clear format.
Challenge: Managing multiple conditions efficiently.
Learning: We developed a better understanding of nested conditions and program structure.
Conclusion
Completing this assignment allowed me to apply structured programming concepts, such as loops, conditional statements, and user input/output. We faced challenges with program logic and syntax errors but overcame them through practice and debugging. We now feel more confident in writing C programs to solve practical problems.
